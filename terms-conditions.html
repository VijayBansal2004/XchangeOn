        5.9. Resolving Disputes: Forum, Arbitration, Class Action Waiver:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Notice of Claim and Dispute Resolution Period:
          Please contact XchangeOn first in case of any disputes. XchangeOn wants to address your concerns without resorting to formal legal proceedings, if possible. If you have a dispute with XchangeOn, then you should contact XchangeOn and a ticket number will be assigned. XchangeOn will attempt to resolve your dispute internally as soon as possible. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute (which discussions shall remain confidential and be subject to applicable rules protecting settlement discussions from use as evidence in any legal proceeding).
          In the event the dispute cannot be resolved satisfactorily, and you wish to assert a legal claim against XchangeOn, then you agree to set forth the basis of such claim in writing in a “Notice of Claim,” as a form of prior notice to XchangeOn. The Notice of Claim must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, (2) set forth the specific relief sought and (3) include your XchangeOn account email. The Notice of Claim should be submitted to an email address or hyperlink provided in your correspondence with XchangeOn. After you have provided the Notice of Claim to XchangeOn, the dispute referenced in the Notice of Claim may be submitted by either XchangeOn or you to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Section, below. For the avoidance of doubt, the submission of a dispute to XchangeOn for resolution internally and the delivery of a Notice of Claim to XchangeOn are prerequisites to commencement of an arbitration proceeding (or any other legal proceeding). During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or XchangeOn shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.
        </li>
        <li>
          Agreement to arbitrate:
          You and XchangeOn agree that, subject to paragraph 1 above, any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and XchangeOn arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Terms or to your relationship with XchangeOn as a user of XchangeOn Services (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms) will be determined by mandatory final and binding individual (not class) arbitration, except as set forth below under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate. You and XchangeOn further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including without limitation any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Agreement to Arbitrate, or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including, if applicable, attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. The arbitration provisions set forth in this Section will survive termination of these Terms. Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall be subject to the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the “ICC”) then in force (the “ICC Rules”), as modified by this Section X. The arbitration will be administered by the International Court of Arbitration of the ICC. Unless the parties agree otherwise, there shall be only one arbitrator appointed in accordance with the ICC Rules. Any arbitration will be conducted in the English language, unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of a member state of the European Union or any other jurisdiction. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. JUDGMENT ON ANY ARBITRAL AWARD MAY BE GIVEN IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION OVER THE PARTY (OR OVER THE ASSETS OF THE PARTY) AGAINST WHOM SUCH AN AWARD IS RENDERED. Time for Filing: ANY ARBITRATION AGAINST XchangeOn MUST BE COMMENCED BY FILING A REQUEST FOR ARBITRATION WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR, AFTER THE DATE THE PARTY ASSERTING THE CLAIM FIRST KNOWS OR REASONABLY SHOULD KNOW OF THE ACT, OMISSION OR DEFAULT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM; AND THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT TO ANY REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIM NOT ASSERTED WITHIN THAT TIME PERIOD. THIS ONE YEAR LIMITATION PERIOD IS INCLUSIVE OF THE INTERNAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH 1 OF THIS SECTION, ABOVE. THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT TO ANY REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIM NOT ASSERTED WITHIN THAT TIME PERIOD. If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law. Process; Notice: The party who intends to seek arbitration after the expiration of the Dispute Resolution Period set forth in paragraph 1, above, must submit a request to the ICC in accordance with the ICC Rules. If XchangeOn requests arbitration against you, XchangeOn will give you notice at the email address or mailing address you have provided. You agree that any notice sent to this email or mailing address shall be deemed effective for all purposes, including without limitation to determinations of adequacy of service. It is your obligation to ensure that the email address and/or mailing address on file with XchangeOn is up-to-date and accurate. Seat of Arbitration: The seat of the arbitration shall be Switzerland. Place of Hearing: The location of any in-person arbitration hearing shall be Switzerland, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. If the amount in dispute is such that the arbitration can be conducted on the basis of documents and/or written submissions only, then the arbitration shall be conducted in this manner, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. The arbitrator shall have the power to award any remedy or relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award under the applicable law. The arbitration award shall be final and binding upon the parties, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
        </li>
        <li>
          Class Action Waiver.
          You and XchangeOn agree that any claims relating to these Terms or to your relationship with XchangeOn as a user of XchangeOn Services (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms) shall be brought against the other party in an arbitration on an individual basis only and not as a plaintiff or class member in a purported class or representative action. You and XchangeOn further agree to waive any right for such claims to be brought, heard, or arbitrated as a class, collective, representative, or private attorney general action, to the extent permissible by applicable law. Combining or consolidating individual arbitrations into a single arbitration is not permitted without the consent of all parties, including XchangeOn.
        </li>
        <li>
          Modifications.
          XchangeOn reserves the right to update, modify, revise, suspend, or make any future changes to Section X regarding the parties’ Agreement to Arbitrate, subject to applicable law. You hereby consent and agree that it is your responsibility to ensure that your understanding of this Section is up-to-date. Subject to the applicable law, your continued use of your XchangeOn account shall be deemed to be your acceptance of any modifications to Section X regarding the parties’ Agreement to Arbitrate. You agree that if you object to the modifications to Section X, XchangeOn may block access to your account pending closure of your account. In such circumstances, the Terms of Use prior to modification shall remain in full force and effect pending closure of your account.
        </li>
        <li>
          Severability.
          If any portion of these Terms is adjudged to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, the remainder of these Terms will remain valid and enforceable and the invalid or unenforceable portion will be given effect to the greatest extent permitted by law. In case of any disputes or issues related to these terms and conditions, users are expected to contact XchangeOn support before raising any legal proceedings.</li>
